Strategy  
• Each Monday at close: compute 4-week momentum (%-return).  
• Hold equal weight in the two assets with highest momentum for the next week (cash otherwise).  

Benchmark = equal-weight buy-and-hold.

**Return:** equity-curve plot, annualised Sharpe ratios, and maximum drawdown for both strategies.
