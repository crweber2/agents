Load seismograph data from earthquake.csv (cols: time [s], accel [m s⁻²]).  
• Detrend and window the signal with a Hann window.  
• Compute the single-sided amplitude spectrum via FFT.  

**Return:**  
– A log-log plot of amplitude vs frequency up to 50 Hz.  
– The three dominant frequencies (Hz) sorted descending by amplitude.
