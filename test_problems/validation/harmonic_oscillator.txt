Integrate d²x/dt² + ω² x = 0 with ω = 5 rad s⁻¹.

Provide a numerical solution to this problem. Analytical solutions will not be accepted.

Initial conditions: x(0) = 0 m,  v(0) = 2 m s⁻¹.

Compute x at t = 2 s and **return that single scalar value**. Do not report any other text other than the value at this location, otherwise the auto-grader will fail you!
