Solve ∇²u = −2 π² sin(π x) sin(π y) on (x,y) ∈ [0,1]² with u = 0 on all
boundaries (Dirichlet).

Provide a numerical solution to this problem. Analytical solutions will not be accepted.

**Report u(0.25, 0.25).** Do not report any other text other than the value at this location, otherwise the auto-grader will fail you!
